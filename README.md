A python library for pinging multiple hosts.

It focuses on providing both sync and asynch versions and minimizing the amount of
of OS resources (only a single socket is used for handling multiple hosts with
multiple ping requests)

Without further ado:

```python
$ python -m asyncio
>>> from multiping.aioping import ping
>>> from multiping.tools import response_text

>>> async for response in ping(["gnu.org", "orcid.org"], count=2):
...    text = response_text(response)
...    print(text)
64 bytes from orcid.org (104.20.228.70): icmp_seq=1 time=4.8ms
64 bytes from gnu.org (209.51.188.116): icmp_seq=1 time=113.4ms
64 bytes from orcid.org (104.20.228.70): icmp_seq=2 time=4.7ms
