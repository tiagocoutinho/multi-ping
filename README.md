A python library for pinging multiple hosts.

It focuses on providing both sync and asynch versions and minimizing the amount of
of OS resources (only a single socket is used for handling multiple hosts with
multiple ping requests)

Without further ado:

```python
$ python -m asyncio
>>> from yaping.aioping import ping
>>> from yaping.tools import response_text

>>> async for response in ping(["gnu.org", "orcid.org"], count=2):
...    text = response_text(response)
...    print(text)
