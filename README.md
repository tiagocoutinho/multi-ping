[![CI][CI]](https://github.com/tiagocoutinho/multi-ping/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A python library for pinging multiple hosts.

It focuses on providing both sync and asynch versions and minimizing the amount of
of OS resources (only a single socket is used for handling multiple hosts with
multiple ping requests)

Without further ado:

```python
$ python -m asyncio
>>> from multiping.aioping import ping
>>> from multiping.tools import response_text

>>> async for response in ping(["gnu.org", "orcid.org"]):
...    text = response_text(response)
...    print(text)
```

Requirements:

* python >= 3.9
